Hey there!   

This is your one-stop shop for the DiverSEA workshop happening on June 13th, 2024.  
We'll be diving into hyperspectral imaging of HYPSO Data. 

To get started, you'll need to download the files found here: [DiverSEA_WORKSHOP_2024 repository](https://folk.ntnu.no/sivertba/diversea/).
And download [this repository from github](https://github.com/sivertba/DiverSEA_WORKSHOP_2024)

Here's what you'll need to do next:

1. **Install conda:** Don't have conda? No worries!  Just download it from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com).

    for troubleshooting the installation see [this repo](https://github.com/NTNU-SmallSat-Lab/hypso-package)

2. **Build the environment:** Once you have conda, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/sivertba/DiverSEA_WORKSHOP_2024/blob/a682cba9b9d6ba4add4de00005b26de0fe16e312/environment.yml) to build the environment you'll need for the workshop.

3. **Download and install software:** You'll also need to download and install two software programs:
   * [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) - a Geographic Information System (GIS) that will be our tool for working with the data.
   * [Quick Map Services plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/quick_map_services/) - a handy plugin for QGIS that will help us visualize our data.

For more detailed instructions on installing the QGIS plugin, check out [here](https://github.com/NTNU-SmallSat-Lab/hypso-package).

That's it! You're all set for the DiverSEA workshop. See you there!
